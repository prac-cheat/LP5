## HPC
1.Design and implement Parallel Breadth First Search and Depth First Search based on existing 
algorithms using OpenMP. Use a Tree or an undirected graph for BFS and DFS . <br>
2. Write a program to implement Parallel Bubble Sort and Merge sort using OpenMP. Use 
existing algorithms and measure the performance of sequential and parallel algorithms. <br>
3. Implement Min, Max, Sum and Average operations using Parallel Reduction. <br>
4. Write a CUDA Program for : <br>
      1. Addition of two large vectors <br>
      2. Matrix Multiplication using CUDA C <br>
5. Implement HPC application for AI/ML domain.<br>

## DL
1.  Linear regression by using Deep Neural network: Implement Boston housing price 
prediction problem by Linear regression using Deep Neural network. Use Boston House price 
prediction dataset. <br>
2.  Classification using Deep neural network (Any One from the following) <br>
1. Multiclass classification using Deep Neural Networks: Example: Use the OCR letter 
recognition dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/letter+recognition 
2. Binary classification using Deep Neural Networks Example: Classify movie reviews into 
positive" reviews and "negative" reviews, just based on the text content of the reviews. 
Use IMDB dataset 
3.  Convolutional neural network (CNN) (Any One from the following) <br>
 Use any dataset of plant disease and design a plant disease detection system using CNN. 
 Use MNIST Fashion Dataset and create a classifier to classify fashion clothing into 
categories. 
4.  Recurrent neural network (RNN) Use the Google stock prices dataset and design a time 
series analysis and prediction system using RNN. <br>
